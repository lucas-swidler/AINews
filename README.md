# AINews
This is a personal project I've been working on over the Fall semester 2021. The goal was to create a news website using completely machine generated text for the articles, based off of a webscraped dataset built from several different websites.

The project is not complete, but I have the following benchmarks in mind to work on in the Spring of 2022:

## Goals:
1. Improve the model: The model was originally run with one GRU layer and 20 epochs, in the future I want to expand the model
2. Create articles: Set the generation to the proper length of articles
3. Create a title generator: Create another similar model for the title of the article
4. Create a website: Build a website to host the articles


I have included the text documents that the model was originally trained on
